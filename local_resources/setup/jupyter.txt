    Shut Down Jupyter Server
    # Shut down a Jupyter server:
    Each server should start on a new port. jupyter notebook list is reading a set of data
    files - each notebook server you run writes a file when it starts up, and attempts to
    remove it when it shuts down. If you see different listed servers on the same port,
    that means some of them exited without being able to remove the file they made. If you
    launch the notebook from a command prompt, you can shut it down by pressing Ctrl-C
    in that same command prompt. If not, you can run jupyter notebook stop 8888

    Run the notebook:
    cd notebooks
    jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser &
    http://34.94.153.121:8888/?token=

    This document describes how you can secure a notebook server and how to run it on a public interface.
